# Description

This is Pushswap:
A project aimed at sorting the inputs using given operations rotate, swap and reverse rotate.
It takes numbers writen in the cmd as inputs converts them into a list and sorts them.
I opted for the turk_algo that i optimized

# Instructions

To run the program either do:
	./push_swap arg1 arg2 arg3 | ./checker_linux arg1 arg2 arg3

or type and type:

	ARG="arg1 arg2 arg3"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker_OS $ARG
	type chmod +x ./checker_linux to make the checker an executable

Note that the first works in all cases.
The second one works only in bash since my program doenst accept multiple numbers in one argument.

This was a big insperation

Ai was used for testing perpouses where i deemed it unescerry to write the whole unit_test by myself
